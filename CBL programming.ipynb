The step frequency was computed by taking the number of peaks and dividing it by the duration of the time interval. These are the steps we executed: \n",

Our method:\n",

Based on typical human walking cadence (0.3–0.6 seconds per step), we enforced a minimum interval of approximately 0.4 seconds between peaks to prevent counting multiple peaks from a single step.\n",

    "When walking, the body moves gently and steadily. The acceleration peaks are few, evenly spaced, and reflect a calm, regular rhythm. Running is faster and more intense: peaks are taller, closer together, and appear more frequently, showing the quick, energetic steps. Climbing stairs tells a different story, peaks are uneven and irregular, reflecting the extra effort of lifting the body and the variable pace. The three different movements leaves a distinct signature in the acceleration data, letting us tell walking, running, and stairs apart at a glance. "
