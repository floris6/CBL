    "Once we have that out of the way, we can starting writing code to estimate the pace. We used the following method: each big acceleration peak (absolute acceleration) equals one step. The problem is: there are a lot of peaks, some small some big. To get a valid estimate of the amount of steps we took, we have to filter the biggest peaks that in reality correspond to the steps. \n",
    "Our method:\n",
    "- Within this interval, the absolute acceleration magnitude was computed from the three acceleration components using: amag = sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2 + az^2). This magnitude signal is used for peak detection because it combines the contributions of all three axes and is less sensitive to sensor orientation.\n",
    "- Step detection was primarily based on the height of the peaks. Only peaks whose magnitude exceeded a threshold — defined as the mean acceleration plus a fraction of its standard deviation — were considered as potential steps. This ensures that small fluctuations and noise are ignored.\n",
    "- In addition, a minimum time distance between consecutive peaks was applied as a secondary check. Based on typical human walking cadence (0.3–0.6 seconds per step), we enforced a minimum interval of approximately 0.4 seconds between peaks to prevent counting multiple peaks from a single step.\n",

    "When walking, the body moves gently and steadily. The acceleration peaks are few, evenly spaced, and reflect a calm, regular rhythm. Running is faster and more intense: peaks are taller, closer together, and appear more frequently, showing the quick, energetic steps. Climbing stairs tells a different story—peaks are uneven and irregular, reflecting the extra effort of lifting the body and the variable pace.
