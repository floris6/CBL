    "This notebook presents the results of a Comprehensive Case-Based Learning (CBL) assignment in Programming, where we collected and analyzed real-world data using smartphone sensors through the Phyphox app. The goal of this project is to see how we can take raw data from phone sensors, process and analyze it, and use it to understand real physical phenomena. The notebook is structured into six main sections:\n",

    "Task 3 – Damped Oscillation on a Swing: Fit a damped harmonic oscillator model to swing motion to extract damping ratio and natural frequency.\n",

The acceleration magnitude is calculated as amag = sqrt(ax² + ay² + az²) and each prominent peak is assumed to correspond to one step. To exclude noise and small fluctuations, only peaks exceeding a threshold defined as the mean acceleration plus 0.2 times its standard deviation are considered. In addition, a minimum time separation of approximately 0.4 s between consecutive peaks is enforced, consistent with typical human walking cadence (0.3–0.6 s per step). The number of peaks that satisfy these criteria is taken as the estimated number of steps within the selected interval. From this, the step frequency is calculated as the number of steps divided by the interval duration, and the walking velocity is estimated assuming a step length of 1 meter."

    "The task shows that step frequency can be reliably extracted from the acceleration magnitude measured by the smartphone accelerometer. Manual peak detection identifies each step by detecting prominent peaks in the signal, providing an accurate estimate of the walking pace. Our method succesfully estimates pace across different forms of motions (walking, running and stair climbing) by adjusting parameters like the minimum peak separation, capturing variations in cadence and step intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When walking, the body moves gently and steadily. The acceleration peaks are few, evenly spaced, and reflect a calm, regular rhythm. Running is faster and more intense: peaks are taller, closer together, and appear more frequently, showing the quick, energetic steps. Climbing stairs tells a different story: peaks are uneven and irregular, reflecting the extra effort of lifting the body and the variable pace.\n",

    "The barometric pressure data shows a smooth and consistent change during the elevator motion, resulting in a stable height estimate after conversion using the barometric formula. In contrast, the accelerometer-based height, obtained through double integration of the gravity-corrected acceleration, exhibits a systematic overestimation due to accumulated integration errors and sensor noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the height comparison graph, the difference between the two methods is most noticeable during the main upward motion (approximately 15–40 s). The barometric height levels off around 28 m, while the accelerometer height overshoots to roughly 29.5 m, highlighting the effect of drift in the integrated accelerometer data. Both curves, however, correctly capture the overall timing and shape of the elevator’s vertical motion.\n",
